# Derma App

Application used to analyze skin changes in order to check danger of cancer. 

### What does it do?

It's very simple. Firstly you take or choose a photo you want to analyze. Next we send it to our server and analyze the image, 
then you receive a response. Score from 0 to 99, if it's more then 90% you should see the doctor.

## How does it look like 

It's just a prototype for now.

## How effective is it?

Currently with good quality photo ideal for our model, the success rate of detecting dangerous changes is nearly 90%.
